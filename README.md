# SimpleConvTrainer

A simple CNN trainer optimized for vision purpousses: fast for prototyping
in a simple way.
What I use this program/utils for is to explore the hyperparameter tunning space
in a broad way,
then choose some prospective model and continue the hyperparameter adjustment 
in a more detailed manner.Of Course, after exploring the hyperparameters, we can change the structure of the
CNN architecture if necessary.


It can be also useful for learning purpouses: How do hyperparameters affect the
performance of a CNN model? Do I normalize the image? What about the batch size?
learning rate?
Simply, call the program with different argument
values and the plots, models and reports will be generated.


Available CNN architectures:
```
- lenet
- minivgg
- karpathynet
- alexnet
- ResNet50
- vgg16 (fixed size)
```

You can change the network architecture class in:
```visutils/neuralnets/conv/{architecture}.py``` file to better suit the project needs.


## Requirements

Required Python libraries:
+ numpy
+ TensorFlow
+ Keras
+ OpenCV
+ scikit-learn

## USAGE
First source the environment with
```

```
this will activate the vision environment and
initialize the `PYTHONPATH`.

To see program instructions:
```
python trainer/main.py --help
````
```

  -o OPTIMIZER, --optimizer OPTIMIZER
                        the optimizer to use for the gradient descent variant
                        step for optimization. Supported optimizers: `adam`

                        the learning rate for optmizer during the gradient
                        descent step.

Training example (simple training):
```
python3 trainer/main.py \
    --architecture lenet \
    --dataset datasets/{the_dataset_name} \
    --model-name {the_model_name} \
    --etha 0.001 \
    --epochs 100
```

Training example (loop for sequential training):
this loop reads values, convert them to a string and assign them to variables
to use in the loop. Here we train 4 models with different etha (learning rate)
and we name them differently
```
for vars in 0.001,02 0.0001,hola 0.0005,05 0.00007,redneuronal
do
    IFS=',' read etha suffix <<< "${vars}";
    python3 trainer/main.py \
        --architecture lenet \
        --dataset datasets/NCWV2 \
        --model-name NCWV2_minivgg_ch3_it150_aug_${suffix}.h5 \
        --epochs 150 \
        --etha ${etha} \
        --optimizer adam
done
```

Testing a model:
To test the performance of the model run modeltester with propriate arg values.
```
python3 tests/modeltester.py \
    --dataset datasets/{testset} \
    --model output/models/{modelpath} \
    --image-size {imagesize}
```
#

## OUTPUTS
The program will output three files
+ A {.h5} file in ```output/model/{filename}``` which represents the keras
compatible CNN model. This file is generated by a callback, which saves the model
if there is improvement in the validation loss metric with the same file name.
(Save best model only)

+ A {.txt} file in ```output/report/{filename}``` which represents the training model
report and the test validation information. This file is generated once at fhe final
stage of the program: after the testing of the model.

+ A {.png} file in ```output/plot/{filename}``` which represents the training plot
metrics monitor over the training phase. This file is generated each epoch
to monitor the training scalar metrics.

## Comments:
Until now I have to fix the creation of the log directory if it doens't exist
for the tensorboard option, that callback produces a log file to be read by tensorboard
in the path ```./logs/```.
